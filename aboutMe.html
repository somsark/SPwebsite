            About Me
        </h2>
            <p> 
                I have a degree in BA 3D Animation and Games with knowledge in 2D & 3D animation, familiarity of storyboarding and excel at coming up with character concept art.
                With the insight of 3D character creation and environmental designing using software like Maya, Zbrush, Photoshop and Unity.
            </p>
        <br>
            <p>
                While in university I took the main role of character concept artist in group projects. Working on 3D character creation involving rigging and animation cycles with an understanding of facial rigging.
                I have worked on variety of assets, environments, concept art, character turnarounds and storyboarding for the world we were creating with the help of the reference taken from organic or manmade objects in reality,
                turning them into fantasy, sci fi and horror allowing the world to be immersive from imagination.
